2022-11-26 poly-v0.8.0

 * override Z3's buggy SIGINT handler (after 100ms)
 * add -T LO:INC:HI option format
 * rename -O OUT-BNDS to -O OBJ-BNDS for uniformity
 * disentangle critical points and fallback solver from ival solver
 * obtaining all solutions to a problem is now handled in a lazy manner
 * splitting intervals no longer skips space between midpoint and next double
 * critical points solver only handles linear derivatives
 * add option -o OBJ-SPEC supporting arbitrary expressions or the expression
   'Pareto(E1,E2,...)' containing such expressions (Pareto optimization is not
   implemented, yet)
 * minor improvements/fixes:
   - simplifier deals with double-neg and unnecessary conj/disj
   - logging
   - fix handling option -c auto
   - report and error on surplus unused arguments
   - empty sequence of solvers
   - ext-solver outputs time to solve
   - print the named outputs (if any)
   - sequence of variables in models is sorted now
   - optimize_EA properly forwards strictness info to obj-range
   - check that none of the objectives is constant on the domain

2022-11-17 poly-v0.7.0

 * moved old options -1 and -c to -C gen-obj and -C clamp
 * introduced structured and colored log output for clarity:
   - verbosity controlled by new option -v
   - log levels are: none, error, warn, info, note, debug; default: note
   - color controlled by repurposed option -c
   - solvers are more verbose in what they are doing
 * support reading options from envvar SMLP_OPTS (if set); parsing the envvar
   string is done by the shell (envvar SHELL if set, 'sh' otherwise), as if
   SMLP was invoked by
     ${SHELL} -c 'exec "$0" ${SMLP_OPTS} "$@"' smlp arguments...

2022-11-15 poly-v0.6.2

 * fix cause for segfault when the search finds that the threshold is out of
   the bounds of the -T list

2022-11-15 poly-v0.6.1

 * -C bnds-dom now affects integer variables as well
 * protection for ival-solver and critical-point solver:
 * - encode unbounded domains properly for fallback solver
 * - critical points are not suitable for (dis-)equality constraints
 * - protect against handling interval domains for integers

 * add u, trace showing final range and contained info and c,/d, trace records
 * generalize search range for GearOpt and add option -T THRESHS
 * relax check on -Cbnds-dom for -r: input bounds empty -> fine
 * ksmt-0.1.7 not supported (missing (get-model)), next version will be
 * simplify and add check for Match() signature
 * fix infix parser: x-y+z was parsed as x-(y+z)
