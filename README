Symbolic Machine Learning Prover
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SMLP is a collection of tools for reasoning about machine learning models.
The main application in this release is smlp-mrc.sh which computes thresholds
for safe regions of neural network models satisfying optput specifications.
Inputs can either be existentially e or universally a quantified, such that
finding thresholds corresponds to solving

	max t s.t. exists region R evaluating to >= t everywhere

where R only has to be bounded in the existentially quantified variables.


See doc/doc.pdf for details on the exact problem statement as well as
technical documentation. Below, we give a quick usage guide.


Prepare SMLP
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ensure that the required packages mentioned below are installed system-wide.
Then, in the smlprover directory, run

	gmake

to build the libcheck-data.so shared library and the documentation.
SMLP is now prepared to run.


Usage
~~~~~
Given an MRC data set in data.csv and a specification file data.spec,

	smlp-mrc.sh -i data.csv -s data.spec -t target-dir run

will create target-dir and compute

1. NNs corresponding to each combination of CH:Byte for RANK=0
2. threshold and safe regions for each CH:Byte
3. thresholds for the above regions extended to the other Bytes per CH

and store the results in target-dir/rank0/shared1.csv.


See doc/spec.pdf for details on the specification format.
